# Lab 0

This project contains the python programs lab0 and step_response (or main on the microcontroller). 
The step response program creates a step input to a pin on the ST32 microcontroller and reads the voltage output to print to the COM port.
The lab0 program is able to reset the microcontroller to reprint the step response and read the printed values to the COM port. 
It then plots the data on a graph.
