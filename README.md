# Lab 0

This project contains the python programs lab0.py and step_response.py (or main.py for the microcontroller). 
The step response program creates a step input to a pin on the ST32 microcontroller and reads the voltage outputs on another pin connected to the circuit to print to the COM port. The lab0 program runs from a computer and is able to reset the microcontroller to reprint the step response and read the printed values to the COM port. 
It then plots the step response data on a graph as seen below, where both the measured (blue line) and theoretical (orange line) voltages are measured against time.
